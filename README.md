# 🧠 Machine Learning Foundations – Statistics, Probability & Data Preparation

This repository contains foundational learning materials to help you understand data before training machine learning models.  
If we don’t understand data first, our models may become **biased, unstable, or misleading** — so statistics is the first step.

## 📌 What is Statistics?

Statistics is the science of collecting, summarizing, analyzing, and interpreting data.

Example:  
If we have students' exam scores:
- **Mean** → Average score
- **Median** → Middle score
- **Standard Deviation** → How spread out the scores are

Statistics helps us **find meaning in data**.

## 🤖 Why Statistics is Important for Machine Learning

Machine learning models learn **patterns from data**.  
If the data has:
- Outliers
- Skewed distribution
- Wrong scaling
- Missing values

Then the model will **learn wrong patterns**.

Statistics helps us:
- Understand center & spread
- Detect outliers
- Identify skewness and long tails
- Scale features & encode categories
- Evaluate model performance correctly

## 📚 Course Modules

### **Module 01 — Descriptive Statistics & Distributions**
| Topic | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Mean, Median, Mode | Measure center of data |
| Variance & Standard Deviation | Measure spread |
| Percentiles & Quartiles | Understand rank within dataset |
| IQR (Interquartile Range) | Outlier detection |
| Z-Score | Standardization |
| Distribution Shapes | Symmetric vs Skewed vs Long-tail |

> **Use Median + IQR** when data is **skewed or contains outliers**.  
> **Use Mean + SD** when data is **symmetrical**.

## 🎯 Week 1 Goal
Build **intuition**, not memorize formulas.

We learn to:
- Summarize data
- Detect outliers
- Understand real-world distributions
- Prepare data for ML models to be **accurate, robust & explainable**
